This repository contains problems to coding challenges and my proposed solutions.

Within each folder: 
    "Problem" contains the description of the problem,
    "Solution" contains my solutions and reasonings
    "Tester" contains the junit used to test my code

I will not be accepting collaborative changes as this is my personal learning,
but feel free to open issues on code you think is incorrect or could be improved.
