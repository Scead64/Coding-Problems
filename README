This repository contains problems to coding challenges and my proposed solutions.

Within each folder: 
    "Problem" contains the description of the problem,
    "Solution" contains my solutions and reasonings
    "Tester" contains the junit used to test my code
    There may be a variety of supplemental classes provided for problems if additional methods or classes are needed.

I will not be accepting collaborative changes as this is my personal learning, with the exception of additional test cases.
but feel free to open issues on code you think is incorrect or could be improved.
